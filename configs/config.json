    "": "Hi, I'm Woodie. I'm a systems developer with strong backend expertise, particularly in Linux environments and socket networking. My programming journey evolved from C++ to Rust, embracing memory-safe for robust systems development. I'm have experience across the stack, including some cross-platform development. Currently, I'm expanding my skillset by learning AI application development to build intelligent systems. My core strength lies in server-side architectures, but I enjoy tackling challenges across different layers of the tech stack.",
